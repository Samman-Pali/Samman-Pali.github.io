								<p>My professional journey is a blend of academic rigor and practical experiences that span across software development, cybersecurity, 
									and customer service/experience. As a Project Manager for the Conference Travel Emissions Tool (CTET) at ANU TechLauncher, I led a team towards 
									creating a sustainable solution for conference planning, emphasizing carbon emission reduction. This experience honed my skills in 
									team management, requirement analysis, and web development using ReactJS.</p>

								<p>I also explored the cybersecurity landscape as an Intern Vulnerability Researcher at Interrupt Labs, where I delved into vulnerability 
									discovery, reverse engineering, and exploit development. My contributions include developing Python plugins for Binary Ninja and 
									engaging in groundbreaking research that culminated in a publication on integrating Semgrep analysis with Binary Ninja.</p>

								<p>Parallel to my technical endeavors, I have accumulated valuable experience in customer service, primarily through my role as Floor 
									Staff & Waiter at Solita Pizzeria & Pasta Bar among other hospitality positions. These roles honed my abilities in effective communication, 
									problem-solving, and the art of delivering exceptional customer experiences. The fast-paced, pressure-driven environment of the hospitality 
									industry taught me the importance of adaptability and maintaining poise under pressureâ€”skills that are universally valuable, especially in 
									technology-driven sectors.</p>

								<p>Heya! ðŸ‘‹</p>
								<p>I'm Samman Palihapitiya, a budding software engineer with a passion for cybersecurity and a interest in the power of coding to solve real-world challenges. 
									Currently, in the final year of my Software Engineering degree at the Australian National University (ANU), I'm majoring in Cyber Security and diving 
									deep into everything from vulnerability discovery to software development.</p>
								
								<p>Outside the digital world, my personal interests include running, photography, and football. Fun fact: the image used in the background of this website was 
									captured by me from the backyard of my home back in 2019! These activities offer me a creative outlet and a way to stay grounded, reminding me that there's 
									always more to learn and explore, whether on a computer screen or in the great outdoors. Not to mention, photography has definitely influenced my artistic decisions
								when it comes to web design.</p>
